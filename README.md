# ChatFire

## About
ChatFire is a very simple Chat application written in swift and xcode 7 to present how you can build very easy apps with firebase. The App is build just with Auto Layout and without storyboards. I will upload more tutorials for iOS , but for now I thought it would be cool to see how you can build a very easy chat app from scratch just by using Firebase. 
### Still in progress
This is not the final build, I will add features like sending images, videos and voice messasges, receiving notifications, etc. (When I find enough time.)

## Used libraries
For ChatFire I used:
###### ALCameraViewController: https://github.com/AlexLittlejohn/ALCameraViewController
###### Firebase: https://firebase.google.com/
###### Snapkit: https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit
###### SwiftMessages: https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages

## Where is iOS 10 ? 
When iOS 10 is launched, I will open a new branch for that.

## Want to contribute ?
Feel free to fork this project and open a new pull request when you are ready :)

## Found an issue ?
Please tell me if you found an issue, so I can improve this code for people who need help with firebase :)

# This is a standalone app !
## I have no connection to Firebase and I'm not the copyright holder for the firebase icon, I just used it because I think it fits best.

## Freelancing
I also do Freelancing work for projects, because I'm a 16 year old student I can't work on too many big projetcs for now but if you have a interesting project or just need help just contact me at: talip.goeksu@gmail.com, and I see what I can do. :)
